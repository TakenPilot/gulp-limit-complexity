Using Mozilla's JavaScript tree mapper to parse functions, and escomplex to calculate the complexity of every function.
This is mainly useful for keeping third-party developers honest and to a certain level of quality.
Can also be useful on large teams as a kind of contract for how complex or readable their code must be.

##Install

```Bash

npm install gulp-limit-complexity

```

##Example

```JavaScript

var limitComplexity = require('gulp-limit-complexity');

gulp.task('complexity', function () {
    return gulp.src(path.src.js)
        .pipe(limitComplexity({
            cyclomatic: 4, //maximum of 4 code paths through any function
            halstead: {
                vocabulary: 10 //maximum of ten for vocabulary
            }
        }));
});

```

##Another example

```JavaScript

var limitComplexity = require('gulp-limit-complexity');

gulp.task('complexity', function () {
    return gulp.src(path.src.js)
        .pipe(limitComplexity({
            halstead: {
                difficulty: 14 //difficulty represents readability
            },
            params: 3 //functions can only have a maximum of three parameters
        }));
});

```


##Another example

```JavaScript

var limitComplexity = require('gulp-limit-complexity');

gulp.task('complexity', function () {
    return gulp.src(path.src.js)
        .pipe(limitComplexity({
            halstead: {
                operands {
                    distinct: 6 //only six unique operands each function
                }
            }
        }));
});

```
